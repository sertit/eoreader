abstract: >
  EOReader is a Python library developed by ICube-SERTIT (University of Strasbourg)
  designed to open, read, and harmonize Earth Observation products (optical and radar)
  from multiple satellite constellations (Sentinel, Landsat, Pl√©iades, SPOT, and more).
  It provides a unified interface to access spectral bands, metadata, cloud masks,
  and other physical parameters, with a strong focus on multi-sensor interoperability.
