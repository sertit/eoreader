"""
Environment variable for setting the vertical CRS of the DEM. 
Only useful to reproject your data with RPCs. 
Not useful if your DEM has already a vertical CRS or if its height is already taken from the ellipsoid.

- EOReader is able to detect the vertical CRS of the COPDEM (if COPDEM or Copernicus in its name).
- :code:`xdem` has also a mechanism of auto-detection of some CRS. See their documentation for more details.
"""

SNAP_DEM_NAME = "EOREADER_SNAP_DEM_NAME"
"""
Environment variable for overriding default DEM name used in SNAP.

Default is :code:`Copernicus 30m Global DEM`.
Can be :code:`GETASSE30`, :code:`SRTM 3Sec`, :code:`External DEM`...

If :code:`EOREADER_SNAP_DEM_NAME` is set to :code:`External DEM`,
SNAP will use your DEM stored in :code:`EOREADER_DEM_PATH` as an external DEM.

USE_DASK = "EOREADER_USE_DASK"

If set (to 1) and :code:`dask` is installed, EOReader will read products as dask arrays instead of numpy arrays with the chunking defined in :code:`EOREADER_TILE_SIZE`.

If set, overrides the default tile size used in chunking (1024 by default, i.e. default chunk is {"band": 1, "x": 1024, "y": 1024}).

BAND_RESAMPLING = "EOREADER_BAND_RESAMPLING"

Overrides the default resampling (bilinear) used when loading bands.
